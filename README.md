NHL player recommendation app. Using cosine similarity and scikit-learn I was able to build a model that can evaluate similarity between players. The app can take in any player from the 2021-2022 season that played over 50 games, and will give you the most similar player, and list the top 5 most similar players. 

The data used for this project is from [MoneyPuck](https://moneypuck.com/data.htm).
